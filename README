This game was designed for two competitors online over a cloud.

- How to play and watch game?

For an example here, the first player starts a game client on a PC, 
and the second player runs another on a device, such as on an Intel 
Galileo board with a touch screen.  Other persons can watch the game 
that player 1 and player 2 on live. Also the histories of a game can 
be played back in watching mode (by passing a game id). 

It is allowed to establish multiple games and watchers for playing back
or watching running games simultaneously.

Note that a game server must be launched first prior to playing a game.

- Steps
Player1:
FiveInRowClient.py -i config.json_pc

Player2:
FiveInRowClient.py -i config.json_touch

Watcher(s):
FiveInRowClient.py -i config.json_pc -g <game_id>

NOTES: 
A configuration file has to be used for the game client to get the 
player's name, screen width and high, and input method, etc., at this 
version of the game. 

For more usage please refer to “FiveInRowClient.py -h”.
